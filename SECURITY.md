# Security Policy

## Staging branch

The `staging` branch is always first point where changes will be introduced, like package updates, features a.s.o.
Package updates from that branch are synced into all [supported branches](#supported-branches) ~2 weeks, to minimize the
size of the changeset, as package updates can occur very frequently.
**Don't** create branches from `staging` as it could be rebased or rewritten at any time.

## Supported branches

Following branches are actively maintained.
